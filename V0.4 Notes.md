# How it works
This program is broken up into two parts:
- The job of taking process and socket information and organizing it into tables that can be easily queried
- The job of deciphering the statuses of the connections and grouping like connections together
## Part 1: Decipher 
The program starts by running two commands to get process and socket information:
```
ps -ao pid,args -w --no-headers | grep "[s]sh .*" > /tmp/ssh_ps
```
and
```
ss -nap | grep "ssh\"" > /tmp/ssh_ss
```

The next part of the program is to use regex to query these and put them into a list

### Process Organization
| ssh_type| Name |
| - | - |
|MS | Master Socket |
| S | Socket Forward (Local, Remote, or Dynamic) |
| TRAD | Traditional Tunnel |
| SH | SSH Session |

These are organized into the following formats

```
[ org_code, pid, ssh_type, command, arguments ]
```

the arguments have a few variations:

Master Sockets:
```
[ socket_file, username, destination, port  ]
```
Forward via MS:
```
[ socket_file, socket_name ]
```
Traditional Tunnel:
```
[ username, destination, port, [ local_port, forward_ip, forward_port ], [ ... ]]
```
Other Session:
```
[ username, destination, port ]
```
### Socket Organization:
These are organized into the following formats

Master Socket:
```
[ org_code, pid, socket_type, socket_file, socket_code ]
```
Other Sockets:
```
[ org_code, pid, socket_type, src, dst ]
```
## Part 2: Figure out what it means
| ord_code | description |
| - | - |
| 0 | unassigned (DEFAULT) |
| 1 | Master Socket (parent) |
| 2 | Socket Forward (child) |
| 3 | Traditional Tunnel |
| 4 | Other SSH Tunnel |

## Part 3: Organize into branching structure
```
[ id, parent, type, [ps_list], [ss_list] ]
```
### ssh_full_list types
| Code | Name |
| - | - |
| MS | Master Socket |
| S_FWD | Socket Forward |
| S_SH | Socket Session |
| TD_MAIN | Traditonal Tunnel (Process Block) |
| TD_FWD | Traditional Tunnel Forward |
| TD_SH | Traditional Tunnel Session |
| SH | Standalone Session |
